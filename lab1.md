2. Smart Questions
	
Suggestions
2.1. Take your time first.
Never put yourself in a position where such a question needs to be solved NOW. If that is the case, either the question is too simple to deserve a question & answer, or you have terribly misallocated your time. Giving yourself time allows you to relax, and fully understand any solutions given to you instead of just treating them as copy-paste because the assignment is due in ten minutes.

2.2. EDIT your question. Treat a question as a work in progress. First, draft it. Then, take a step back, and read it as if you were going to try and answer it. Are there grammar mistakes? Did you fail to be specific enough (versions, dependencies, etc.). Is it just a big code dump saying "This doesn't work? HALP!" Editing your question before you even post it shows people you cared enough the ask properly. Also, keep up to date with the answers/comments and edit your question accordingly; it shows you are truly invested in the issue.

2.3. Read through The stack overflow FAQ, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE: [FAQ](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7931/faq-for-stack-exchange-sites)

2.4. If you can, ask a knowledgable friend or colleague in person. Often the easiest, and quickest solution if this available. Just make sure you're not interrupting them too much.


3. Chapter 3 of Free Culture

Hmmm....The case study highlighted in this chapter is alarming, but unfortunately not terribly surprising. Perhaps it might have back in 2004 when this book was published, however many similar cases have been brought to trial in the time since then. The underlying problem is that the culprit of the crime are the users, who are just too many to make a case against. However, to anyone with eyes, it is clear that it is in no way Jesse's fault. In fact, since he had no control over ANYTHING that users made public (not to mention didn't even make the underlying search engine), this case is clearly ludicrous. You have to ask yourself why the RIAA thought this was a prudent course of action; the MOST amount of money they could come away with is $12k, as opposed to the millions they "deserved." A much more sensible action would be to file a lawsuit against RPI (who would then be able to successfully defend against it), or even try asking RPI/Jesse to blacklist copyrighted music (or just music) for their search engine. The sad part? I guarantee you the RIAA thought of this. Then they probably realized they wouldn't get a dime from RPI, and decided to bully Jesse for his lunch money.
